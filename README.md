#  About Me
I am a **new student** studying *Software Development*. I have just began my course and I am still finding my feet when it comes to coding. I am learning how to use GitHub right **now**.
Over the next 6 months I want to:
1. Pass all my programming assessments
2. Become a more confident Java programmer
3. Find some small projects that will get me using Java
4. Find some small projects that teach me other programming languages

Watch this space for all my projects!
